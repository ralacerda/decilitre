<h2>Installatio and Usage</h2>
<p>You can utilize Decilitre with SCSS by overriding the default values and importing only the necessary modules for your project. Alternatively, you can customize Decilitre using CSS custom properties, giving you control over the styles even without a build step.</p>
<p>Additionally, Decilitre opt-in utility classes can be used independently of the modules. This approach allows you to leverage the utility classes without including the entire set of styles or, alternatively, use only the styles without relying on the utility classes. This flexibility provides a modular approach to suit different project requirements and preferences.</p>
