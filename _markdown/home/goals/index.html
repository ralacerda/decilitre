<h2>Goals and Motivations</h2>
<p>Decilitre was created to address the repetitive nature of writing CSS code for basic styling and utility classes. While there are other similar projects available, the goal of Decilitre is to focus on providing good defaults and essential utility classes, getting out of your way as soon as possible.</p>
<p>One of the core principles of Decilitre is to ensure that every CSS rule has a specificity of 0. This means that you can easily override the provided styles without encountering specificity conflicts.</p>
<p>Decilitre does not aim to be a comprehensive CSS framework or a full reset or normalizer. Its primary focus is on providing essential and non-intrusive code that you would typically write anyway. This means that while using Decilitre, you will still need to write CSS, but you can focus solely on the styles that are specific to your project.</p>
